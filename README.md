# PIC16F877A-TUTORIALS
# Introduction
Even easiest tutorials like led blinking is added to help anyone at any level.
The main purpose of these tutorials is to help people who wants to build similiar or same circuits.
I build most of these circuits in real life too, but because of the qualities of images were very low I did not upload them.

# Programs

<p>Proteus ISIS v8.10 is used as simulator</p>
<p>MPLAB X IDE v4.05 is used for assembly language</p>
